- **Kotlin Calsee:** This is just for fun! :) This is just a sample calculator app which is built with Kotlin ü¶∏ superpower and *Modern Android development* tools!




## Built With üõ†
- ```Kotlin``` - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- ```Fragment``` - A fragment is a small piece that's come off a larger whole, and to fragment is to break
- ```ViewModel``` -  The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage the UI-related data. In this app, each ViewModel is associated with one fragment.
-  `LiveData` -  LiveData is an observable data holder class that is lifecycle-aware. LiveData is observable, which means that an observer is notified when the data held by the LiveData object changes.
-  `Binding` - It‚Äôs a library which allows you to bind the data of your models directly to the xml views in a very flexible way.
- ```Layout``` - A layout defines the structure for a user interface in your app, such as in an activity. All elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. A View usually draws something the user can see and interact with.
- ```Activity``` - An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with setContentView(View).
